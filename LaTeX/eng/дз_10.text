Being a celebrity: a dream or a nightmare?

Sometimes we might think: "It would be great to be a celebrity", but I guess almost never thinks about other side of being famous

On one hand, when you're famous you can have all the material stuff like rings, cloth e.g. Many people loves you AKA fans, they energise you and make you feel needed

On the other hand, there're some sort of trick, when you're celebrity you just can't live as a regular person, I mean you just can't hang out with your friend with no cam, or sunglases + make up. Your like is always under interest of the interviewers. And many ppl starts trying to scam you, or just use to get smth from you.

So to summurise, when you're celebrity, you can have all the material stuff but as well you can lose smth more, like close friends, ability of being just a human.
