Smart Dust Management System for Cleaner Streets in St. Petersburg


St. Petersburg is a big beautiful city, despite all its grace and beauty, it has a problem with street dust. Dust is a big problem in huge cities, although at first glance it is a small thing, in fact, dust and air quality in general greatly affect lungs. So finding solution is a very important mission. 


The solution I propose is a smart dust management system. The system that consists of smart dust sensors that are placed in different locations around the city. So those sensors will showing the most contaminated places in the city in real time and by that sweepers will clean that place. If the place is polluted too often, then we can plant trees there.

But those solution are not cheap, in addition to that, we need to take care of data and security of the system, because if someone hacks the system, it can be a big problem. Another worry is that people are not very happy of seeing robots on the streets. Another worry is that new rules for construction companies, like covering dusty materials, could be hard to enforce. 


So to summarize, the smart dust management system is a great solution for cleaner streets in St. Petersburg. It will help to monitor air quality and take action when needed. However, it is important to consider the costs and potential challenges of implementing such a system.
