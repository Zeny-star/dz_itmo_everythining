Hi Tom,

I just got out of the airport, and I wanna to tell you about what happened on the plane.
At first, our flight was delayed for 2 hours, and then when we got on board, it turned out that someone got sick, and that made another 1.5 hours of waiting; after that, we finally took off.
After 6 hours of flight, we finally arrived, but that wasn't the end. The company lost my luggage. Just to know, at this point I was so exhausted that I just wanted to drop everything and go to sleep at the hotel, but I had to wait another 2 hours, after which I was told that I could go home and wait for the call, and so here I'm writing this letter.

All the best,
Evgenij
