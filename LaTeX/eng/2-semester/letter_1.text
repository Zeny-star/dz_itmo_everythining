Is music overestimated among today's youth?

Nowadays, music takes a big part of our lives; some people even become addicted to it, feeling impossible to live without it. But I think music has downsides, especially if you mindlessly listen to a lot of music on a regular basis; I would call it 'doomlitening.'.

I don't think that listening to music gives you a lot; in fact, a bit of music can negatively affect perception of new because music can greatly overload the brain. Many people, including myself, have tried listening to music while studying, but practice shows that silence is just better for studying/working.

Another problem is that some people are trying to become a musician/rapper because they see all of the stars and think that they can do it too, but there's a very low success rate, and most of the people just give up on this road. At the end, those people don't have anything except disappointments.

In the end, I want to say that music is a very important part of our lives, but because of this, people should think more about it. Music is just entertainment, and you shouldn't devote too much to it.
